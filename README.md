Calculation of Rt values from COVID-19 daily case counts

We require statistical consultation and support for a public health study analyzing data for several Public Health Units in the province of Ontario.

The first analysis will be:

1. Calculate weekly Rt values from the daily COVID-19 case counts from the attached Excel file (i.e. between March 1 and now) for Ontario, Waterloo, York, Toronto, and Peel region.

The second analysis will be:

2. Segmented regressions to identify changes in slope/breakpoints in the behavior of Rt over time (and shifts in COVID-19 transmission trends) in each of the Public Health Units and Ontario as a whole. Please see the example attached.

Regressions will be based on zero to eight breaking points, using slope changes/discrete regression segments with at least five data points per segment. Calculate the best-model’s intercepts and slopes, using separate intercepts at each different segment, allowing for separate identification of increases or decreases in Rt, and sudden “jumps” or “plunges” in daily values.
